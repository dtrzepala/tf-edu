## Example 2

### Remarks

- example 2 covers
  - backend
  - handling more resources
  - splitting to separate files
  - use of variables
  - use of outputs
  - loops
  - where to look for documentation

### Steps

1. There might be different backend storages but for this example we will use azure storage. It's probably the only resource you create manually for the project. Also, it needs to be protected with proper permissions so not everybody has access to it.
   1. create resource group e.g. `rg-tfbackend`
   2. create azure storage account `stterraformfisexamples{yourname}`(must be globally unique) with blob container e.g. `states`
   3. modify `storage_account_name` to match your storage account name
   4. run `terraform init`. The state file with the key specified in the backend.tf file should be created.
